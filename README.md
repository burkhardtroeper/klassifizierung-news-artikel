# Classification of German News Articles
Text classification is a standard application of ML. Here I show an example of such a classification by means of news articles in German language.

As data source the "10k German News Articles Dataset (10kGNAD)" is used. It was taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/tblock/10kgnad

The prefabricated split into training and test data was reversed and new split was created.
Tensorboard was used for the evaluation. With this tool the learning process can be visualized very nicely. Tensorboard has to be installed (pip install Tensorboard).
